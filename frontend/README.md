# Falcon Airlines — Frontend (React)

This folder contains a minimal React frontend (Vite).

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo `Delay Prediction` page posts to `/api/predict`. In development you should proxy that path to your Python backend or adjust fetch URL accordingly.

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If you want, I can add `react-router` and convert the existing HTML forms into React components next.
